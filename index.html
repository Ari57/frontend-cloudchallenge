    <li>Using Qlik Sense to build informative and interactive reports for our Data Quality Check operational reporting, enabling self-service MI and Audit reporting.</li>
    <li>Design and implementation of a Python module to reformat project data for use with PI Planning, increasing the accuracy of our PI Planning reports and reducing the possibility of human error.</li>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I enjoy swimming to keep fit and de-stress. I also enjoy coding for fun; one project I’m undertaking for learning is a testing project to get an idea around how QA Testers perform automation. Quality Assurance has always interested me because I find it fascinating to understand the process of how bugs are found and corrected.</p>
